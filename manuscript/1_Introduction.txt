# Introduction
[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a Python micro webframework with minimalistic design, with no database abstraction layer, form validation, etc. Even Python beginners could pick up Flask in no time. Nevertheless, Flask supports many third-party extensions, allowing developers to build full-fledged web applications. Companies such as Pinterest, and LinkedIn use Flask for the applications.

## Setup
Install [Python](https://www.python.org/). Python 3.5+ is recommended.
Create a virtualenv for the project (this is included with Python 3.5+)
{format: bash, line-numbers: false}
```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
Install Flask
{format: bash, line-numbers: false}
```
pip install Flask
```

## Hello World Application
Create a minimal Flask app with the file `app.py` in your favorite editor
{format: ruby, line-numbers: false, caption: "app.py"}
```
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'
```
Here we create a Flask app instance, and an index route (`/` or `/index`) which returns a simple string.
Run the app with
{format: bash, line-numbers: false}
```
FLASK_APP=app.py flask run
```
Visit <http://127.0.0.1:5000/>, you should the hello world text displayed.
